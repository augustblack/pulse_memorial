The Pulse Memorial is a web based tribute to the forty-nine lives lost in the shooting at the Pulse Bar in Orlando, Florida. This speculative project, accessible via web broadcast, aims to honor queer grief and remember the victims amidst a backdrop of heightened societal tensions. The web based audio broadcast draws inspiration from Toni Morrison's concept of "disremembering," the memorial challenges narratives of erasure and amplifies the voices of the marginalized. Through a continuous stream of sound crafted from numerical data associated with each victim, the memorial disrupts the everyday with vibrational sonic experiences, fostering remembrance and healing. Utilizing the Janus WebRTC gateway, the broadcast ensures seamless communication and media exchange, facilitating a collective space for reflection and commemoration. This initiative harnesses the power of online platforms to create inclusive digital communities and resist normative structures. By embracing the web's potential for storytelling and identity expression, the Pulse Memorial embodies a transformative approach to memorialization and remembrance. Through sound, networking, and digital presence, it endeavors to challenge queer erasure and honor those whose stories have been overlooked or forgotten.
